APQP—Product Design & Development in Cold Chain Context

Overall Stage Goal

At this point in APQP, design features are almost final, but still open to refinement based on Voice of Customer (VOC), operational feasibility, and cold chain compliance needs.

Even if the product design comes from the customer or brand owner, the cold chain supplier/distributor must still review it critically to ensure it can:

Survive the chilled/frozen supply chain without damage or spoilage.
Meet HACCP/ISO 22000 requirements for safety and quality.
Be manufactured, packed, stored, and transported at scale within temp control limits.

Key Planning Steps in Cold Chain

1. Prototype Build – Verify VOC Compliance

Build sample runs of the product and packaging to confirm it matches what the customer actually values — e.g., texture, flavor, shelf life.

A frozen bakery prototype might be tested for crust crispness after 6 months at –18°C and reheating.

Cold chain twist: Also test “temperature abuse” resilience — e.g., what happens if the frozen meat spends 30 minutes at –10°C during loading?


2. Feasible Design Check
Ensure the design can be manufactured at required volumes without breaking cold chain controls.

For chilled mascarpone: Filling equipment must keep product under 8°C during packing, even at peak throughput.

For frozen fish: Carton design must allow fast freezing to ≤ –18°C core within 4 hours.
Factors to confirm:
	Production volume capability.
	Timing vs. shelf-life window.
	 Unit cost and packaging material availability.


3. Feasibility Studies & Control Plans

Based on engineering drawings and specs, anticipate where in manufacturing cold chain risks could occur.

Eg: Identify a sealing machine as a potential failure point if it overheats packaging film and weakens the seal.

4. Preliminary Feasibility Analysis
Early risk review for potential manufacturing + cold chain problems:
Will handling frozen cartons at –20°C cause material cracking?
Will chilled beverage caps shrink during blast chilling, causing leaks?

Outputs (Cold Chain Context)

Design Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (DFMEA)

Identify possible design failures and their cold chain consequences.

Seal failure in frozen fish vacuum packs → freezer burn → off-odor → customer complaint.

Use FMEA scoring (Severity × Occurrence × Detection) to prioritise risks like seal integrity, oxygen ingress, temperature drift.

Design for Manufacturability & Assembly (DFMA)
Make sure the design can be produced efficiently in a temp-controlled environment.
Cold chain considerations:
Limit number of manual handling steps in chilled rooms (reduce exposure).
Choose materials that stay flexible at low temps.
Packaging that stacks without crushing under cold room humidity.

Points applied to cold chain:
	1.	Design, Concept, Function, Sensitivity to Variation — e.g., lid fit changes if plastic shrinks in cold storage.
	2.	Manufacturing/Assembly Process — avoid steps that generate heat in chilled zones.
	3.	Dimensional Tolerances — ensure jars fit in auto-fill lines without sticking at low temps.
	4.	Performance Requirements — maintain seal integrity from –20°C to +5°C.
	5.	Number of Components — fewer = faster packing in cold rooms.
	6.	Process Adjustments — ability to adapt fill weight for seasonal density changes in dairy.
	7.	Material Handling — pallets must fit reefer floor rails without extra repacking.
